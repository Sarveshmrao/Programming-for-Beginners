* <span class="c21">[What exactly is programming?](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming)
>Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.
 Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.
 </span>

* <span class="c7">[What are the programming languages?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)
>A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax use to create a software program. Languages that programmers use to write code are called "high-level languages." This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is recognized directly by the computer hardware.
</span>

  * <span class="c0">[How programming languages are made?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-create-a-programming-language#:~:text=The%20origin%20of%20a%20programming,the%20actual%20code%20being%20written.)
>The origin of a programming language is pretty simple: a programmer somewhere notices that she or he is writing the same patterns over and over.

>The programmer realizes that the way they are thinking about programs is conceptually abstract and powerful in a way that isn't evident in the actual code being written. So the programmer thinks to themselves: "What is the core essence of the ideas I am expressing in code? And how can I represent those ideas in a way that is simpler, more succinct, and easier to see what is going on?"

>This conceptual simplification, and a strategy for expressing it in words and symbols, becomes the germ of an idea for a new language.

# <span class="c6 c22">What exactly is programming?</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Is it just full of mathematical equations and 0’s and 1’s?</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Or is it just all about some alien language typed really fast on a keyboard?</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Well in reality</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">It’s just a step by step instructions</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Given to a computer to get from input to output</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">How we get from that one point to the other is This black box or set of instructions.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">And the funny thing is that: this black box can be: A circle A triangle or any other shape you mould it to be.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">Java, Python,C,C++,C#,Kotlin,Dart,Javascript..</span>

<span class="c0">You can name them. But what exactly are these?</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">A computer or any electronic device can understand only machine language.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">That is ON and OFF or 1’s and 0’s or True or False or simply to say whether current flows or not.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span class="c0">So, a programming language in simple terms is just a tool used by us to communicate with computers.</span>

<span class="c0"></span>

<span>Programming syntax is a set of grammatical rules</span> <span>that a programmer</span><span> has to follow for that particular programming language. A man-eating</span><span> tiger</span><span class="c0"> was caught. A man-eating tiger was caught.</span>

<span class="c3">Let's write our first line of code in Python Open the IDE</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">---- EXPLAIN IDE HERE----</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<a id="t.ea0d00af0e6d92c23dfaffaa067defb21788e707"></a><a id="t.0"></a>


```python
name=input()
print("Hi", name)
```


<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">I'll explain this in a sec</span>

<span class="c3">Run</span>

<span class="c3">Enter your name</span>

<span class="c3">Congrats! You ran your first line of code!</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">Now for the explanation</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c19">Here name is something that we call a variable. I like to think of variables as empty boxes that can hold some value.</span>

```python
name=input()
```

<span class="c3">`input()` is a function (later on that)</span>

<span class="c3">What it does is wait for the user to give some input in the form of text. In the last slide, I entered SMR which was then stored as text in the variable (imagine as a box) ‘name’.</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">This is easier than the last one</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

<span class="c3">`print()` is the function like `input()`. Inside the brackets ‘()’ we specify what we want to show as an output on the screen.</span>

```python
print("Hi", name)
```

<span class="c3">In Python code, text that needs to be stored or printed or displayed should always be inside “double quotes like this”.</span>

<span class="c3"> Then we add a comma and write the ‘name’ variable which contains what we imputed earlier- “SMR”.</span>

<span class="c3"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Code your own calculator</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let’s code our own calculator in Python. Open Python IDE</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Type the code below in the editor</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<a id="t.e0e13ab8830f910dd562333b15ff6f6649a2d706"></a><a id="t.1"></a>

```python
calculate = input(">>>")  
print(eval(calculate))
```

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Click run Type 9 + 57 or any other numbers and press enter</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Now let's break down what we just did.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

```python
calculate = input(">>>")
```

<span class="c11 c26 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">On line 1 we declare a variable called calculate. As I told in the previous chapter, variables are what we use to put data or information in Python.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">`input()` is something that we use to get input from the user. The text inside the (), here “>>>”. Will be shown just before where the user types (the questions).</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Don’t panic, you’ll get this in a second!</span>

```python
print(eval(calculate))
```

<span class="c6 c4">Just like math, Python gives priority to (brackets) first.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">So what will have the most priority?</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

```

-Calculate (more)

--eval</span>

---print (less)
```

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Here, calculate stores the mathematical expression as a string (text). This expression is simply what needs to be calculated or run. Here: 9 + 57</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">eval() is a simple function that executes Python code. This means 9+57 is executed in Python and returns a value of 66.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

```
print(eval(calculate))
|    |    | “9 +57” ||  |
|    |-------------- |  |
|    |      66       |  |
|    |---------------|  |
|  Outputs 66 on-screen |
|-----------------------|

```
<span class="c30 c4"></span>

<span class="c4 c30"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">That’s it!</span>

<span class="c6 c4">In the next chapter, we will learn more about multiplication, division and many other things we can do with this calculator!</span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Operations in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">In the last chapter, we made a calculator using Python. Let’s try doing some basic math operations.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Last chapters code</span>

```python
calculate = input(>>>)
print(eval(calculate))
```
<span class="c6 c4">Last chapter we had done addition. Now let’s try some other operations.</span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Arihtmetic operations</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Subtraction -</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Following is the syntax of Python Subtraction Arithmetic Operator with two operands.

`result` = `operand_1` - `operand_2`
where `operand_1` and `operand_2` are numbers and the result is the difference of `operand_2` from `operand_1`.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Multiplication *</span>

<span class="c6 c4">For multiplication, we use *(asterisk) arithmetic operator ( +, -, * are also arithmetic operators in python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Following is the syntax of Python Multiplication Arithmetic Operator.

`result` = `operand_1` * `operand_2`
where `operand_1` and `operand_2` are numbers and the result is the product of `operand_1` and `operand_2`.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Division /</span>

<span class="c6 c4">For division, we use forward slash between the numbers</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Notice how the result is 4.0 and not just 4</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We will discuss this in a later chapter</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Modulus %</span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is a special operator found in programming languages that divides two numbers and returns the remainder.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Comparison Operations</span>
<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Equal to ==</span>
<span class="c6 c4">If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.

`a`==`b`
</span>

## <span class="c6 c13"> Not equal to !=</span>
<span class="c6 c4">If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.

`a`!=`b`
</span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Greater than ></span>
<span class="c6 c4">If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.

`a`>`b`
</span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Less than <</span>
<span class="c6 c4">If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.

`a`<`b`
</span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Greater than or equal to >=</span>
<span class="c6 c4">If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.

`a`<=`b`
</span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Less than or equal to <=</span>
<span class="c6 c4">If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.

`a`>=`b`
</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>
<span class="c6 c4">This operators are mainly used for condition checking...</span>


<span class="c6 c4">Let’s test what we have learned</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Recall from the last chapter that what's within a bracket (parentheses) is given more priority first.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">DIY Challenge</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Write a program</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Make a variable called numberOfPens (don’t leave space between variable names) and assign it a value of 25\.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Then make another variable called cost (cost of a pen) of value 5.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Print out the total cost on the screen.</span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Datatypes In Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Every programming language has data types.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">These define the type of data that is stored.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">What we’ll learn Integer String Float Boolean</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">IDE BRO!!!</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Integers</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Just like math, integers include both negative and whole numbers.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

`x=90`

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is how you store integers in a variable.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">In python, you don’t need to specify variable type during declaration like you do in other languages like C and Java.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Strings</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Strings are used to store data as text.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

`text = “ Stay Home Stay Safe”`

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Strings should always be enclosed within either single or double-quotes. You can store it on multiple lines by enclosing between three single or double-quotes.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

`text = ””” This is a multi-line text”””`

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Float</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Floats are just a fancy way of calling a number with a fractional value.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

```python
y= 24.3

print(type(y))
```

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">To make a float, you simply add a decimal point after the whole number value.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">The second line will print the type of data, variable y is holding. Here, a float</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Boolean</span>

<span class="c6 c4">When you want to store something that can have only two possible values, like yes or no you can use booleans.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

`programmingIsFun = True`

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Booleans can be either True or False (notice the caps).</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We will work with booleans in another chapter.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Casting</span>

<span class="c6 c4">If you want to change the type of data, like integer to string, you can use the casting feature in python.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

```python
X = str(5)
print(type(x))
```

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Str is short for the string. When you run this code, you will find that x is of type string and not an integer.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

*String `str()`

*Integer `int()`

*Float `float()`

*Boolean `bool()`

# <span class="c6 c22">Joining strings in python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Concatenation or adding strings together</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Adding two strings</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>
```python
Text = “Hi, I am “

name = “SMR”

print(text + name)
```
<span class="c6 c4">Use the IDE for testing</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can easily add two strings in Python and use the print function on them.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Notice the space I left between am and “. The same whitespace( ) is found while printing. ( Try removing it and run the code)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

## <span class="c6 c13">Adding strings with numbers</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Try running this code:</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">age = 24</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(“Age is “ + age)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Don’t panic this would get an error message. This time, let us try to understand the error message. Understanding these are a crucial part of being a programmer.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Line2 this shows on which lie the error was found</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Type error…..</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We can see that there was a TypeError (when you use the correct data types in an operation) - you cannot add an integer under string in Python.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">But you can change an integer into a string, and then add them. (Concatenate)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Any idea on how to do this?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Try taking this as a challenge. Try to solve it yourself. You may refer to the last chapter for help on casting.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Answer</span>

<span class="c6 c4">age = 24</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(" Age is " + str(age))</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can do the same with floats. Also, try casting a Boolean into an integer.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">That's it, for now, one step closer to being a master programmer.</span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Control flow in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Control flow is an important programming concept.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">It is one that makes programming special.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">But what is a control flow?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Control flow determines the order in which each line of code is run. To achieve this we utilise conditions, loops, and function calls.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">First, let's start with conditions.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Hungry?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">No (false)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Yes (true)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's code</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Eat food</span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is a simple abstraction of how we use conditions in real life.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Using something similar, we can control how some code is run - the order in which it is executed or run.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">So the next question will be:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">How can we apply this in programming?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">And that's exactly what will be dealing in the next chapter:  control flow with conditions</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22"></span>

<span class="c0"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Conditions in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Extra to implement the hungry flow chart from the last chapter.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is the flowchart we dealt with yesterday. Let's try to implement this in our code.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">First, we need to figure out how to implement the yes or no feature.  but how?</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Recall that there is a data type called Boolean, which can have two possible values - true and false. This with exactly our need.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Now how are you going to check if something is true or false, and then execute the specific program for that specific situation?</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">For that will introduce conditional statements.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">If, else and elif (else if)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c29 c26">Basic syntax:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">if somethingIsTrue:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Execute this part of code</span>

<span class="c6 c4">elif SomethingElseIsTrue:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Execute this</span>

<span class="c6 c4">else:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Execute this</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Now, let's implement the flowchart in code.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">hungry=true()</span>

<span class="c6 c4">if hungry:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Eat Food")</span>

<span class="c6 c4">else:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Let's Code")</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c4">You can change hungry's value to false. I am</span> <span class="c4">hungry so</span><span class="c6 c4">.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's break it down!</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We set hungry to true</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Check if the condition is satisfied.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">If satisfied execute the below code.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Notice the white space here?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">It is used to tell Python that whatever comes after the above line with such white space and: should be executed ( if condition satisfied).</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">This whitespace is called an indentation. Which is usually 4 spaces or tab, use the tab key to create 4 spaces like this.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">If the, if statement is not satisfied to execute this not, is the indentation.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">While loop in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Looks are very useful for running code multiple times without rewriting</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Basic while loop structure</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Start -> Checks if condition is satisfied</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">True -> Do something return to start</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">False-> Exit loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Now with this structure in mind, how can we repeat something n times?</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's try to do something five times</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Start</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Create a variable called counter and set it to 0 initially.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">-></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Check if counter is less than 5</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">True -> do something and increase the counter by 1</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">False-> exit loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">In the first cycle from check back to check counter equal to zero in the next cycle it will become one</span>

<span class="c6 c4">the value will increase till 5 before exiting the loop because at the cheque lekin entrance we can check whether the counter is less than 5</span>

<span class="c6 c4">if not win counter is equal to 5 we will stop implementing that is increasing the countess value and exit the loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c29 c26">While loop syntax</span>

<span class="c6 c4">while condition:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Do something</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's code it</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">counter=0</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Set counter equal to zero at start</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">while condition < 5: --- this is a conditional expression. More on that later. What it basically does is return true or false depending on the expression.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Eg. 2 > 1 is the same as true and 3 < 5 is the same as false.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Here in the first cycle it would be 0 < 5 which is the same as true.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print(counter) -- Prints the value of counter in each cycle.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c4">counter = counter + 1 --- this might look a bit weird at first if you look</span> <span class="c4">at like math</span><span class="c6 c4">. but what it does is return the value of the counter increased by 1 and store in the counter variable itself.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">print("done") --- after the loop is done this line is executed. Notice that the indentation separates this line from the while loop.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Unlike traditional while loops, You can also include an else part for the while loops in python which will be executed once when loop condition is false. See an example below</span>

<span class="c6 c4">counter = 0</span>

<span class="c6 c4">while counter < 3:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Inside loop")</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   counter = counter + 1</span>

<span class="c6 c4">else:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Inside else")</span>


<span class="c6 c4">Output</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside else</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">For loops in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">In this chapter we will try to implement the same thing as last, but using a for loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c29 c26">For loop with a range syntax.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">for i in range(5):</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Do something</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">This does exactly what we did last time with a while loop.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's break it down..</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">In each cycle, the value of i changes to the number below the cycle number.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We start a for loop with a keyword called for.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">We start a for loop with a keyword called for. The i here is called an iterator ( you can name it anything). The range(5) does the i=i+1 (counter in the last chapter). Just like the last time, the value of i will be 0 in the first cycle and go till 5 (0,1,2,3,4) without including 5\.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">for i in range(5):</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print(i)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(“Done”)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">I hope there’s no need of further explanation for this. What this will do is print 0-4 on separate lines and then print Done.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can use i just as a variable, but only within the for loop (intended part after : till end of information)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Same as while loops, for loops can also have an optional else block. See an example below</span>

<span class="c6 c4">for i in range(3):</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Inside loop")</span>

<span class="c6 c4">else:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   print("Inside else")</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside loop</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Inside else</span>



<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Challenge</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">In this challenge you will have to use for loop to print steps made of # like:</span>

<span class="c6 c4">#</span>

<span class="c6 c4">##</span>

<span class="c6 c4">###</span>

<span class="c6 c4">####</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">You should take an integer input by int(input()) since input() takes a string as input by default. Use that as a hint to make a program that will print steps dof height n units. Eg: Above is steps of 4 unit height. Use “#” * 3 to print ###</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Lists in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Before we jump into the rest of control flow, let’s learn about lists and some other data types that are very useful.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Suppose that you want to store the names of animals in a mini zoo. How will you do that?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You could create a variable and store names of each separately.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c4">animal1</span><span class="c6 c4"> = “Lion”</span>

<span class="c4">animal2</span><span class="c6 c4"> = “Giraffe”</span>

<span class="c4">animal3</span><span class="c6 c4"> = “Elephant”</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c4 c6">But this would be insufficient and hard to manage if we had 1000’s of animals.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is where lists come in. You can do the same thing now in</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals= [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">A single Line! Yes</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">To create a list just use two square brackets like a=[]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">A single list in python can store data of all types.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">a= [ 5, ‘a string’, True, 10.4]</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Accessing values in List with index</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can access data in list by their index number eg: listname[index]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals= [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animals[0])</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: Lion</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Because programmers start counting from 0</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals= [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animals[-1])</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: Elephant</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can also count in reverse</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Adding items to a list</span>

<span class="c4">Add items to the end of list using</span> <span class="c4">listname.append</span><span class="c6 c4">(data)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals= [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals.append(‘Zebra’)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animals)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’, ‘Zebra’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Removing items from lists</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c4">Remove the last item from list using</span> <span class="c4">listname.pop</span><span class="c4">() or specify the item’s index by</span> <span class="c4">listname.pop</span><span class="c6 c4">(index)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals= [‘Lion’, ’Giraffe’, ’Elephant’]</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals.pop()</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animals.pop(0)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animals)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">There are much more things that you can do with Python. But these are enough for us as beginners.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Dictionaries in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Just like lists, dictionaries are another useful data structure.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Suppose you want to store the name and age of animals in a mini zoo.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You could do like :</span>

<span class="c6 c4">lion=5</span>

<span class="c6 c4">elephant=6</span>

<span class="c6 c4">giraffe=3</span>

<span class="c6 c4">turtle=50</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">But again, this is inconvenient when we have dictionaries.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">With dictionaries the same thing can be written as</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges = {‘lion’:5, ‘elephant’:6}</span>

<span class="c6 c4">                Key         Value</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Writing full would take more space</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Basic syntax:</span>

<span class="c4">dictionaryName</span><span class="c4">= {key1:value1,</span> <span class="c4">keyN</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c4">ValueN</span><span class="c6 c4">}</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Multiple lines are allowed</span>

<span class="c6 c4">We can understand that dictionaries use key-value pairs .</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Keys are just like the keys you will use to open a safe and retrieve the data in it.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Retrieving data from dictionaries</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges = {‘lion’:5, ‘elephant’:6}</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animalAges[‘lion’])</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: 5</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">We first specify the dictionary name and then use square brackets within which the key goes in. eg: dictName[key]</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Keys and values can be anything: string,int,float even booleans!</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c26 c29">Adding new data</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Use syntax: dictionary[newKey] = value</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges = {‘lion’:5, ‘elephant’:6}</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges[‘cat’] = 2</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animalAges[‘cat’])</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: 2</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c29 c26">Removing Items</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Use syntax: dictionary.pop(key)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges = {‘lion’:5, ‘elephant’:6}</span>

<span class="c6 c4">animalAges.pop(‘lion’)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">print(animalAges)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Output: {‘elephant’: 6}</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

# <span class="c6 c22">Functions in Python</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Functions play an important role in every programming language.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Suppose you want to perform a task over some data in a particular part of code.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">And now you want to repeat it again somewhere else.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Repeating the same lines of code would be considered a bad practice because of DRY ( Don’t Repeat Yourself)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">This is where functions come in!</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

### <span class="c29 c26">Functions</span>

<span class="c6 c4">You can think of an entire program as a factory</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Then the functions would be the machines used.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Without machines it would be like making a separate machine each time for the same task.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">def machineName():</span>

<span class="c6 c4">   Tasks this machine can do</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">def keyword is used to define a function.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Then we specify the function name and open brackets followed by a colon</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Let's code something</span>

<span class="c6 c4">def welcome(name):</span>

<span class="c6 c4">    print(“Welcome”, name)</span>

<span class="c6 c4">welcome(“SMR”)</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">On the first two lines, we create the function and specify what it does.It takes an argument (name) which is a raw material given to a machine to get a product.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">The last line welcome(“SMR”) we call the function just like running a machine. The raw material (argument) here is “SMR” as string.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Finally it prints a welcome message.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Challenge</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Make a simple function that prints the double of any number you give as an argument. Eg: 8 is an argument. Output: 16</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">Call the function whatever you want</span>

# <span class="c6 c22">What Next?</span>

<span class="c6 c4">By now, I hope all of you have a basic understanding of programming in Python.</span>

<span class="c4">Building a</span> <span class="c4">base knowledge</span><span class="c6 c4"> and strengthening it is always important.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">First, I want you to search in Google for w3-schools Python. W3schools is an awesome website for referring from.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">On the website, by the left, you will find all the topics that we have covered +more.</span>

<span class="c6 c4">Go through each topic we have talked about and do all the simple exercises in it.</span>

<span class="c6 c4"></span>

<span class="c6 c4">That’s it!</span>
